      <h2>Our Founder</h2>
      <span class="line"></span>
      <span class="bold">Jennifer L. Escobedo, P.E.<br />
        Principal</span>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Ms. Escobedo grew up in New Jersey, attended Widener University and graduated with her B.S. degree in Civil
          Engineering. She then moved to Indiana where she attended graduate school at Purdue University and graduated
          with her M.S. degree in Civil Engineering in 1996.</p>
        <p>After graduation in 1996, Ms. Escobedo started working at a local firm in Indianapolis as a junior roadway
          engineer. In 2000 she was offered a position in Las Vegas, joining one of the companies working on the Hoover
          Dam Bypass project. In 2002 she began working in Land Development, and that is when her passion for civil
          engineering started to grow.</p>
        <p>
          Ms. Escobedo most recently served in the capacity of Regional Manager for a national engineering firm where
          she had an opportunity to develop and cultivate relationships beyond her expectations. Her passion for civil
          engineering, along with the support she has received from some very influential members in the industry, have
          led to the establishment of CIVIL 360 LLC.
